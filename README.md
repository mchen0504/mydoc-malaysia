## Project Description

To maximize life-saving potential, patients require efficient access to medical information and connections to the right doctors. However, doctors’ information is scattered in Malaysia. Patients often rely on word-of-mouth or long searches on individual hospital websites to search for doctors. Moreover, these sources do not accurately reflect the service quality of doctors. MYDoc is a web platform designed to bridge this information gap in Malaysia. By gathering doctors’ information in a single web application, users can both efficiently search for doctors’ information and recommend doctors to others. Through MYDoc, we strive to simplify the healthcare-seeking process for patients in Malaysia.

## If you are interested in continuing the project:

### Current Implemented Features:

Doctors:

- Create an account and submit verification documents (Malaysian Identity Cards, certified copy of Medical Degree, etc.) to verify doctor identity
- List practice by completing and publishing profile

General users:

- Search for doctors/hospitals by specialty, doctor name, hospital name, and condition (body map)
- If logged in, users can report, save, “like” (recommend) or tag a doctor (using positive tags that are predefined)
- Read a doctor’s detailed profile information including years of practice, work location, qualifications, procedures performed, and conditions treated.
- Learn ways to book appointments with a doctor

### Future Actions to take:

- Conduct more onsite user testing to become more user-friendly
- Optimize the website performance by improving database design
- Recruit more doctors in Malaysia to sign up and provide their information so users can easily find them
- Improve Search by Condition feature by having medical professionals to map more body parts, symptoms, and conditions to each specialty

### Additional Features Worth Implementing:

- Localize the website by using locize to include Malay language
- Book appointment through MYDoc
- Online medical consultation
